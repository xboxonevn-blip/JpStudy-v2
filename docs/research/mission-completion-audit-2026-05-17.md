# Mission Completion Audit - 2026-05-17

Timestamp: `2026-05-17T20:02:18+07:00`

Objective source: `C:\Users\xboxo\Desktop\PC\Goals JP study.txt`

This is a current-state audit, not a completion claim.

## Success Criteria

The active mission is complete only if all are true:

1. Sprint 1-7 source and documentation work are shipped on `main`.
2. User feedback addenda T6-T10 and later content, FSRS, CI, and route-bootstrap addenda are shipped or explicitly documented as deferred.
3. D2 editorial approval state is honest, with no Codex-created `vi-human-approved` claims.
4. CI/CD, Firebase rules, deploy, and live smoke gates pass on `main`.
5. Live route matrix preserves seeded level for core N4/N3/N2/N1 direct hash routes.
6. Public/beta launch blockers are closed with real evidence: legal approval, Sentry first issue, deletion proof, GA4 retention proof, GA4 exported learning events, and App Check enforcement. Firebase Storage migration proof is descoped for beta by owner decision on 2026-05-17.

## Missing Evidence

These items cannot be honestly closed by repo edits alone:

1. Legal reviewer/date/evidence for `/privacy` and `/terms`.
2. Sentry DSN, secret-backed smoke run with `sentry_smoke=true`, and first deployed issue URL.
3. A real deletion proof against a dedicated test UID/support ID.
4. GA4 Admin retention Console/API proof.
5. App Check enforcement after the beta monitoring window.

Firebase Storage note: cloud backup and legacy migration are not beta
requirements. The project remains on Spark, Storage setup would require Blaze,
and local file export/import is the beta backup path.

App coherence note: Phase 1 fixed the source-aware lesson vocab query and
regenerated the content manifest. The follow-up P0 patch added level-scoped
storage lesson IDs for N3/N2/N1, made lesson route links carry `level=`,
kept loading totals hidden until data resolves, added vocab loading timeouts,
and removed the double navigation in shell branch taps. Live deploy rechecked
`/#/lesson/1`, `/#/lesson/26?level=N4`, `/#/lesson/1?level=N3/N2/N1`,
`/#/vocab`, `/#/premium`, and `/#/search`. Remaining work: Phase 2 level-store
unification and IA cleanup.

Phase 2 update: level changes now persist through one helper path instead of
feature-local direct writes. Kanji, Vocab, Onboarding, Home, Search, Library,
Memory, Profile, Grammar, and Exam surfaces read the same persisted study level
after route reloads and direct hash entry. A guard test prevents new
`studyLevelProvider.notifier.state` writes under `lib/features`. The follow-up
live check used a fresh browser context with `flutter.onboarding.level=n2` and
confirmed `/exam-center` renders N2-specific heading/cards. Remaining work:
Phase 3 information-architecture cleanup and route consolidation.

Full live audit note: `full-audit-2026-05-17.md` supersedes the prior IA-first
ordering. P0 source fixes were built, deployed, and live-verified on
2026-05-17T14:13+07:00. Lesson study is no longer blocked by zero vocab totals
or shell branch URL/content desync in the checked routes.

Phase 3 update: the shell is now five primary destinations (`/`, `/learn`,
`/review`, `/exam-center`, `/me`). Legacy `/roadmap` and `/today` redirect to
`/`; `/memory` redirects to `/review`; `/community` redirects to `/me`; old
lesson mode URLs (`learn-enhanced`, `flashcards-enhanced`, `test-enhanced`,
`write-mode`, `match-mode`) redirect to `/lesson/:id/practice/:mode`. The dead
Community placeholder module was removed, Review screen title now matches the
Review shell label, and duplicate `/progress` routing was reduced to the Home
branch. Remaining work: Phase 4 lesson detail decomposition, product-identity
cleanup, practice-mode reduction, and copy polish.

Phase 4 update: lesson detail is split into screen/controls/card parts, fixed
curriculum lessons no longer expose user-set edit/add/combine/copy affordances,
`/lesson/:id/edit` redirects to the lesson detail route, old match practice
aliases redirect to Test, the Kanji study-flow card now opens the kanji grid,
Home achievement notifications are non-blocking, and the live SRS write path
no longer updates legacy SM-2 `box`/`ease` values. Remaining work: Phase 5
learner-copy cleanup and broader generated-schema/user-set isolation if "My
sets" is revived after beta.

Phase 5 update: learner-facing copy has been rewritten away from developer and
product jargon. Stale test expectations were updated to assert the new copy,
Design Lab was removed from learner routing/source, premium plan copy now uses
plain study outcomes rather than analytics/challenge jargon, and roadmap
fallback titles no longer expose raw IDs. Local verification passed: analyze,
UI string guard, content taxonomy guard, node research tooling, and full
Flutter suite. The follow-up Phase 6 polish and full-app P0 audit source work
are now shipped; remaining work is external launch proof.

Phase 6 update: the remaining polish patch limits the foundations/Kana
soft-suggest dialog to N5 learners, confirms the search index already includes
vocab/kanji/kana through source and tests, and normalizes remaining vocab
CTA/path wording. It was committed as `812b4e0`, pushed to `main`, built with
the local App Check key, deployed to `hosting:jpstudy`, and live-verified after
clearing browser cache/service-worker state. Primary Hosting returned `200`;
legacy `jpstudy-v2.web.app` returned `404`. Remaining work: external launch
proof gates and any newly added full-app P0 audit follow-up.

D6 contrast follow-up: Vocab flashcard hint text now uses `ink 0.64` and has a
light-surface AA regression test. Commit `669347cf` was pushed to `main`,
locally built, manually deployed, then covered by GitHub Actions run
`25991138754` on current HEAD `aac13d31`; deploy-hosting, live resource smoke,
and Lighthouse live gate all passed. Sentry smoke remains skipped until
`JPSTUDY_SENTRY_DSN` is configured.

Kanji per-language update: Hán-Việt rules are no longer routed through the
N5-only Kana gate, and Kanji UX now switches by UI language for detail, search,
lesson Kanji list, reading practice, and handwriting practice. Commit
`4747b677` was pushed to `main`, built, and deployed. Follow-up `b07d10f6`
fixed a Flutter web-only handwriting seed crash discovered during live proof.
Live proof covers Japanese Kanji detail, Japanese Search Hán-Việt keyword
gating, Japanese lesson Kanji tab, Japanese Kanji Reading, and Japanese
Handwriting; Japanese definitions still need real data rather than English
fallback.

Kanji DB regression update: owner-reported VI/N3 Kanji grid and handwriting
load failures were traced to existing content DBs that could be at schema v34
while missing the physical `kanji.meaning_ja` column. Commit `ed47e8ae` adds a
before-open/on-upgrade self-heal and regression fixtures for v34/pre-v33 DBs.
Local verification passed focused DB tests, analyze, UI string guard, taxonomy
guard, content status report, and full Flutter suite (`2326`). Firebase Hosting
was redeployed, then a live Playwright matrix verified VI/EN/JA across N5-N1:
Kanji grid rows and `Write/Viết/書く` handwriting practice loaded with zero
console errors.

Kanji runtime repair update: follow-up QA found public content repair could
deadlock when called before the first Drift content DB query. Commit
`833ed3c8` moves `beforeOpen` to the private non-reentrant ensure path, makes
the public ensure report whether content was repaired, and ensures repository
Kanji cache invalidation runs once per lifecycle or after actual repair. Local
verification passed focused DB/reachability/coverage/taxonomy tests, analyze,
UI string guard, and node research tests. Firebase Hosting was redeployed; live
proof verified VI N3 grid, VI handwriting, EN grid, JA grid, and JA `214`
radicals load real data.

Kanji content expansion update: N3 lesson 18 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan, and local lesson context. Commit `777a5c13` replaces the
lesson's false `vi-human-approved` file tag with truthful `vi-source-verified`,
fills Hán-Việt/display/search/related-kanji metadata for all eight entries,
bumps the Kanji seed revision to `19`, and adds a lesson-18 sentinel. Local
coverage audit reduced N3 incomplete current entries from `63` to `55`;
live proof opened `裁` with `Tài (xét xử; phán quyết; cắt may)`.

Kanji content expansion update: N3 lesson 19 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan, and local lesson context. Commit `7be4d16` corrects `材`
from the wrong Vietnamese gloss `tài liệu` to ingredient/material meaning,
fills Hán-Việt/display/search/related-kanji metadata for all eight entries,
bumps the Kanji seed revision to `20`, and adds a lesson-19 sentinel. Local
coverage audit reduced N3 incomplete current entries from `55` to `47`;
live proof opened `材` with `Tài (nguyên liệu; vật liệu; gỗ)`.

Kanji content expansion update: N3 lesson 20 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan, and local lesson context. Commit `edd1ac06` fills
Hán-Việt/display/search/related-kanji metadata for all eight emotion/psychology
entries, bumps the Kanji seed revision to `21`, and adds a lesson-20 sentinel.
Local coverage audit reduced N3 incomplete current entries from `47` to `39`;
live proof opened `感` with `Cảm (cảm xúc; cảm giác; cảm nhận)`.

Kanji content expansion update: N3 lesson 21 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan, and the local economy/finance theme. Commit `008767e8`
fills Hán-Việt/display/search/related-kanji metadata for all eight entries,
bumps the Kanji seed revision to `22`, and adds a lesson-21 sentinel for `財`.
Local coverage audit reduced N3 incomplete current entries from `39` to `31`;
live proof opened `財` with `Tài (tài sản; của cải; tiền bạc)`.

Kanji content expansion update: N3 lesson 22 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan, and the local communication/expression theme. Commit
`c0aea700` fills Hán-Việt/display/search/related-kanji metadata for all eight
entries, bumps the Kanji seed revision to `23`, and adds a lesson-22 sentinel
for `説`. Local coverage audit reduced N3 incomplete current entries from `31`
to `23`; live proof opened `説` with
`Thuyết (giải thích; học thuyết; ý kiến)`.

Kanji content expansion update: N3 lesson 23 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan, and the local history/politics theme. Commit `b32bf246`
fills Hán-Việt/display/search/related-kanji metadata for all eight entries,
bumps the Kanji seed revision to `24`, and adds a lesson-23 sentinel for `歴`.
Local coverage audit reduced N3 incomplete current entries from `23` to `16`;
live proof opened `歴` with `Lịch (lịch sử; trải qua; quá trình)`.

Kanji content expansion update: N2 lesson 02 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan where available, and existing N2 vocabulary context. The
local patch fills Vietnamese display/search/readings/related-kanji metadata
for all eight entries, bumps the Kanji seed revision to `28`, and adds a
lesson-02 sentinel for `挙`. Local coverage audit reduced N2 incomplete
current entries from `192` to `184`; live proof opened `挙` with
`Cử (giơ lên; nêu ra; tổ chức; hành động)` and console errors/warnings `0`.

Kanji content expansion update: N2 lesson 03 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan where available, and existing N2 vocabulary context. The
local patch fills Vietnamese display/search/readings/related-kanji metadata
for all eight entries, bumps the Kanji seed revision to `29`, and adds a
lesson-03 sentinel for `圧`. Local coverage audit reduced N2 incomplete
current entries from `184` to `176`. Initial live proof found a Hosting cache
regression: the browser reused an old non-fingerprinted `main.dart.js`, so the
latest sentinel was not running even though the JSON asset was current. Commit
`dff7a998` now makes Flutter shell/content assets revalidate while keeping
`sqlite3.wasm` and `drift_worker.js` on long cache. After redeploy, live
headers showed `main.dart.js=no-cache` and content JSON `no-cache`; normal
reload fetched `main.dart.js` from network, and VI/N2 search opened `圧` with
`Áp (áp lực; nén; ép)` plus console warnings/errors `0`.

Kanji content expansion update: N2 lesson 04 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan where available, and existing N2 vocabulary context. Commit
`2683dea2` rewrites the eight lesson entries (`甘`, `余`, `編`, `物`, `危`,
`怪`, `荒`, `粗`) into learner-ready Vietnamese, corrects `物` away from the
wrong `knitting, web` source gloss, fills readings/search/related-kanji
metadata, bumps the Kanji seed revision to `30`, and adds a lesson-04 sentinel
for `甘`. Local coverage audit reduced N2 incomplete current entries from
`176` to `168`; full Flutter tests passed (`2340`). After deploy, live VI/N2
search opened `甘` with `Cam (ngọt; dễ dãi; nuông chiều)` plus console
warnings/errors `0`.

Kanji content expansion update: N2 lesson 05 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan where available, and existing N2 vocabulary context. Commit
`c33fb9a1` rewrites the eight lesson entries (`争`, `改`, `著`, `有`, `難`,
`在`, `安`, `易`) into learner-ready Vietnamese, corrects `有`/`難` away from
the generated `grateful` word gloss, fills readings/search/related-kanji
metadata, bumps the Kanji seed revision to `31`, and adds a lesson-05 sentinel
for `争`. Local coverage audit reduced N2 incomplete current entries from
`168` to `160`; full Flutter tests passed (`2340`). After deploy, live VI/N2
search opened `争` with `Tranh (tranh chấp; cạnh tranh; cãi nhau)` plus
console warnings/errors `0`.

Kanji content expansion update: N2 lesson 06 is now source-verified against
KANJIDIC2, Unihan where available, and existing N2 vocabulary context. Commit
`4358efd3` rewrites the eight lesson entries (`案`, `外`, `言`, `出`, `付`,
`意`, `義`, `生`) into learner-ready Vietnamese, corrects generated word-gloss
drift in `外`, `出`, and `生`, fills readings/search/related-kanji metadata,
bumps the Kanji seed revision to `32`, and adds a lesson-06 sentinel for `案`.
Local coverage audit reduced N2 incomplete current entries from `160` to
`152`; full Flutter tests passed (`2340`). After deploy, live VI/N2 search
opened `案` with `Án (ý tưởng; phương án; vụ việc)` plus console
warnings/errors `0`.

## Verdict

Implementation, docs, tooling, CI/deploy, and N4-N1 live direct-route fallback work are substantially complete. The active goal is not complete because the stopping condition includes external legal/ops proof gates that remain missing.
