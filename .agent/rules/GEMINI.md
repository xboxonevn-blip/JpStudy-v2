> This file defines how the AI behaves in this workspace.

## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### 1. Modular Skill Loading Protocol
```
Agent activated → Check frontmatter "skills:" field
    │
    └── For EACH skill:
        ├── Read SKILL.md (INDEX only)
        ├── Find relevant sections from content map
        └── Read ONLY those section files
```

- **Selective Reading:** DO NOT read ALL files in a skill folder. Read `SKILL.md` first, then only read sections matching the user's request.
- **Rule Priority:** P0 (GEMINI.md) > P1 (Agent .md) > P2 (SKILL.md). All rules are binding.

### 2. Enforcement Protocol
1. **When agent is activated:**
   - ✅ READ all rules inside the agent file.
   - ✅ CHECK frontmatter `skills:` list.
   - ✅ LOAD each skill's `SKILL.md`.
   - ✅ APPLY all rules from agent AND skills.
2. **Forbidden:** Never skip reading agent rules or skill instructions. "Read → Understand → Apply" is mandatory.

## 📥 REQUEST CLASSIFIER (STEP 2)

**Before ANY action, classify the request:**

| Request Type | Trigger Keywords | Active Tiers | Result |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| **QUESTION** | "what is", "how does", "explain" | TIER 0 only | Text Response |
| **SURVEY/INTEL**| "analyze", "list files", "overview" | TIER 0 + Explorer | Session Intel (No File) |
| **SIMPLE CODE** | "fix", "add", "change" (single file) | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (lite) | Inline Edit |
| **COMPLEX CODE**| "build", "create", "implement", "refactor" | TIER 0 + TIER 1 (full) + Agent | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **DESIGN/UI** | "design", "UI", "page", "dashboard" | TIER 0 + TIER 1 + Agent | **{task-slug}.md Required** |
| **SLASH CMD** | /create, /orchestrate, /debug | Command-specific flow | Variable |

## TIER 0: UNIVERSAL RULES (Always Active)

### 🌐 Language Handling

When user's prompt is NOT in English:
1. **Internally translate** for better comprehension
2. **Respond in user's language** - match their communication
3. **Code comments/variables** remain in English

### 🧹 Clean Code (Global Mandatory)

**ALL code MUST follow `@[skills/clean-code]` rules. No exceptions.**

- Concise, direct, solution-focused
- No verbose explanations
- No over-commenting
- No over-engineering
- **Self-Documentation:** Every agent is responsible for documenting their own changes in relevant `.md` files.
- **Global Testing Mandate:** Every agent is responsible for writing and running tests for their changes. Follow the "Testing Pyramid" (Unit > Integration > E2E) and the "AAA Pattern" (Arrange, Act, Assert).
- **Global Performance Mandate:** "Measure first, optimize second." Every agent must ensure their changes adhere to 2025 performance standards (Core Web Vitals for Web, query optimization for DB, bundle limits for FS).
- **Infrastructure & Safety Mandate:** Every agent is responsible for the deployability and operational safety of their changes. Follow the "5-Phase Deployment Process" (Prepare, Backup, Deploy, Verify, Confirm/Rollback). Always verify environment variables and secrets security.

### 📁 File Dependency Awareness

**Before modifying ANY file:**
1. Check `CODEBASE.md` → File Dependencies
2. Identify dependent files
3. Update ALL affected files together

### 🗺️ System Map Read

> 🔴 **MANDATORY:** Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` at session start to understand Agents, Skills, and Scripts.

**Path Awareness:**
- Agents: `.agent/` (Project)
- Skills: `.agent/skills/` (Project)
- Runtime Scripts: `.agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/`


### 🧠 Read → Understand → Apply

```
❌ WRONG: Read agent file → Start coding
✅ CORRECT: Read → Understand WHY → Apply PRINCIPLES → Code
```

**Before coding, answer:**
1. What is the GOAL of this agent/skill?
2. What PRINCIPLES must I apply?
3. How does this DIFFER from generic output?

## TIER 1: CODE RULES (When Writing Code)

### 📱 Project Type Routing

| Project Type | Primary Agent | Skills |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **MOBILE** (iOS, Android, RN, Flutter) | `mobile-developer` | mobile-design |
| **WEB** (Next.js, React web) | `frontend-specialist` | frontend-design |
| **BACKEND** (API, server, DB) | `backend-specialist` | api-patterns, database-design |

> 🔴 **Mobile + frontend-specialist = WRONG.** Mobile = mobile-developer ONLY.

### 🛑 Socratic Gate

**For complex requests, STOP and ASK first:**

### 🛑 GLOBAL SOCRATIC GATE (TIER 0)

**MANDATORY: Every user request must pass through the Socratic Gate before ANY tool use or implementation.**

| Request Type | Strategy | Required Action |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| **New Feature / Build** | Deep Discovery | ASK minimum 3 strategic questions |
| **Code Edit / Bug Fix** | Context Check | Confirm understanding + ask impact questions |
| **Vague / Simple** | Clarification | Ask Purpose, Users, and Scope |
| **Full Orchestration** | Gatekeeper | **STOP** subagents until user confirms plan details |
| **Direct "Proceed"** | Validation | **STOP** → Even if answers are given, ask 2 "Edge Case" questions |

**Protocol:** 
1. **Never Assume:** If even 1% is unclear, ASK.
2. **Handle Spec-heavy Requests:** When user gives a list (Answers 1, 2, 3...), do NOT skip the gate. Instead, ask about **Trade-offs** or **Edge Cases** (e.g., "LocalStorage confirmed, but should we handle data clearing or versioning?") before starting.
3. **Wait:** Do NOT invoke subagents or write code until the user clears the Gate.
4. **Reference:** Full protocol in `@[skills/brainstorming]`.

### 🏁 Final Checklist Protocol

**Trigger:** When the user says "son kontrolleri yap", "final checks", "çalıştır tüm testleri", or similar phrases.

| Task Stage | Command | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Manual Audit** | `python .agent/scripts/checklist.py .` | Priority-based project audit |
| **Pre-Deploy** | `python .agent/scripts/checklist.py . --url <URL>` | Full Suite + Performance + E2E |

**Priority Execution Order:**
1. **Security** → 2. **Lint** → 3. **Schema** → 4. **Tests** → 5. **UX** → 6. **Seo** → 7. **Lighthouse/E2E**

**Rules:**
- **Completion:** A task is NOT finished until `checklist.py` returns success.
- **Reporting:** If it fails, fix the **Critical** blockers first (Security/Lint).


**Available Scripts (12 total):**
| Script | Skill | When to Use |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `security_scan.py` | vulnerability-scanner | Always on deploy |
| `dependency_analyzer.py` | vulnerability-scanner | Weekly / Deploy |
| `lint_runner.py` | lint-and-validate | Every code change |
| `test_runner.py` | testing-patterns | After logic change |
| `schema_validator.py` | database-design | After DB change |
| `ux_audit.py` | frontend-design | After UI change |
| `accessibility_checker.py` | frontend-design | After UI change |
| `seo_checker.py` | seo-fundamentals | After page change |
| `bundle_analyzer.py` | performance-profiling | Before deploy |
| `mobile_audit.py` | mobile-design | After mobile change |
| `lighthouse_audit.py` | performance-profiling | Before deploy |
| `playwright_runner.py` | webapp-testing | Before deploy |

> 🔴 **Agents & Skills can invoke ANY script** via `python .agent/skills/<skill>/scripts/<script>.py`

### 🎭 Gemini Mode Mapping

| Mode | Agent | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **plan** | `project-planner` | 4-phase methodology. NO CODE before Phase 4. |
| **ask** | - | Focus on understanding. Ask questions. |
| **edit** | `orchestrator` | Execute. Check `{task-slug}.md` first. |

**Plan Mode (4-Phase):**
1. ANALYSIS → Research, questions
2. PLANNING → `{task-slug}.md`, task breakdown
3. SOLUTIONING → Architecture, design (NO CODE!)
4. IMPLEMENTATION → Code + tests

> 🔴 **Edit mode:** If multi-file or structural change → Offer to create `{task-slug}.md`. For single-file fixes → Proceed directly.

---

## TIER 2: DESIGN RULES (Reference)

> **Design rules are in the specialist agents, NOT here.**

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Web UI/UX | `.agent/frontend-specialist.md` |
| Mobile UI/UX | `.agent/mobile-developer.md` |

**These agents contain:**
- Purple Ban (no violet/purple colors)
- Template Ban (no standard layouts)
- Anti-cliché rules
- Deep Design Thinking protocol

> 🔴 **For design work:** Open and READ the agent file. Rules are there.
